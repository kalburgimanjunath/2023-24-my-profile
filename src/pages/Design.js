                The word ‘Kaizen’ means continuous improvement. Never settle for
                mediocrity—There's always room to make our designs better, one
                iteration at a time.

              <div>
                Good design balances between aesthetics & functionality while
                showing empathy towards the user's emotions, behaviours, and
                jobs-to-be-done.

              <div>
                The design details of a product reflects its brand. From
                spacing, typography, component sizing to micro-copy, each
                element should be meticulously crafted.

              <h1>Surprise</h1>
              <div>
                Subtle interactions, playful animations, and creative copy—Tiny
                design elements like these create magical user experiences.
